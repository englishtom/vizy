# Configuration
Create a `vizy.php` file under your `/config` directory with the following options available to you. You can also use multi-environment options to change these per environment.

The below shows the defaults already used by Vizy, so you don't need to add these options unless you want to modify the values.

```php
<?php

return [
    '*' => [
        'iconsPath' => '@webroot/icons/',
    ]
];
```

## Configuration options
- `iconsPath` - Provide a file system path for a collection of SVG icons. These are available when creating your Block Types for a Vizy field. This also accepts environment variables or aliases.

## Control Panel
You can also manage configuration settings through the Control Panel by visiting Settings â†’ Vizy.

## Editor Configuration
You can provide configuration files for the editor by providing a `.json` file with its configurations, very similar to how the [Redactor](https://plugins.craftcms.com/redactor) plugin works. From this file, you can define what buttons are shown, what order and more. This can be particularly useful in maintaining consistent configurations for your Vizy fields across projects.

:::tip
Ensure your file is valid JSON, taking care of trailing commas, and double quotes around properties.
:::

For example, create a `vizy` folder in your `/config` directory, and inside that, create a `Minimal.json` file. Place the following content into that file:

```json
{
    "buttons": ["italic", "bold", "undo", "redo"]
}
```

Here, we're setting the buttons available to the editor to only show Italic, Bold, Undo and Redo (in that order). All other buttons and functionality will be disabled.
